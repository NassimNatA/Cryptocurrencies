# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to process cryptocurrency data with a machine learning model via unsupervised learning and a clustering algorithm. Findings will be presented with data visualizations to determine efficiency in processing the data, clustering the data, reduceing your dimensions, and how reducing the principal components using PCA or clients preparing to get intothe crytpocurrency market.
